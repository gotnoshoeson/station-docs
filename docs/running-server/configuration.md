# Adding Your Music

After installation, use the artist portal to manage your music.

## Artist Portal

Visit your artist portal:

```
https://your-subdomain.your-domain.com
```

From there you can:
- Upload albums and tracks
- Edit metadata
- Manage your artist profile
- View listener statistics

## That's It

The portal handles everything. No config files to edit.

## Advanced Configuration

If you need to customize ports or other settings, the config file is at:

```
~/.station/config.yaml
```

But for most artists, the defaults work fine.
