# Welcome to Station

Run your own decentralized music server and share your music directly with listeners.

## What is Station?

Station is a decentralized music streaming platform that puts **you** in control. Instead of uploading to a central platform, you run your own server and stream music directly to listeners through a peer-to-peer network.

**No middlemen. No platform risk. Just you and your fans.**

## Why Station?

- **You own it** - Your server, your music, your rules
- **Can't be shut down** - No company can deplatform you or change the terms
- **Direct connection** - Get paid directly by your supporters
- **Always available** - As long as your server runs, your music is accessible

## Getting Started is Easy

We've done the hard work to make setup simple. Get your Station server running in minutes:

```bash
curl -sSL https://qnch.network/install | sudo bash
```

That's it. The install script handles everything.

## What You Need

- A server (VPS recommended, ~$5/month)
- Or run it from home
- That's it

## Next Steps

→ [Install Station](../running-server/installation.md)
→ Check out the [listener app](https://listen.station.fm)
